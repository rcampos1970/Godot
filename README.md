# Godot
Godot /ˈɡɒdoʊ/[a] is a cross-platform, free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license. It was initially developed by Argentine software developers Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur for several companies in Latin America prior to its public release. The development environment runs on multiple operating systems including Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Android, and web. It is designed to create both 2D and 3D games targeting PC, mobile, and web platforms and can also be used to develop non-game software, including editors.
